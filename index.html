        <img src="/winlabsd2021/static/imgs/raw%20image.jpg" alt="raw image">
        <p>Our image data is largely dashcam images taken in New York City.
          The images were captured in all five boroughs and at all times of day.
          Images provided by Nexar.</p>

          </figure>

          <p>We noticed that the object detection model was havinng trouble identifying people in dim images.
            To make the results more clear, we sorted our pictures by time. Any pictures taken at night were
            discarded as no people would be detected. </p>

            <p>We ran the YOLOv3 object detection model on our images.
              We paired this with a script to draw colorful boxes around any human YOLO detected.
              We sorted out any images where YOLO detected no people, including images with only
              blurry or partial representations of people.</p>

              <p>One idea we tried was cropping the image around the detected people with a script.
                We ran these image patches through a program to increase the resolution of the patches.
                Between these four super-resolution methods, ESPCN worked the best,
                because we detected the most people with this method.</p>
